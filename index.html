				<!-- <h4>A Lost Shepard</h4>
				<p>
					Lost for days in the caverns of the Dewagal Valley, the only
					thing in shorter supply than food and water is hope.
				</p>
				<p>
					It has been a week since you found this cavern while
					searching for your lost goats. It is your job to tend to the
					animals from the herds of the Kindaroo village. An honorable
					if undistinguished job, but only honorable if you do it
					successfully.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your water skin and shepard's pack hand empty from your
					shoulder, but you still tightly grip your herding staff,
					which you now use to navigate the pitch black labrynthine
					tunnels beneath the Gujur Kush mountains of your tribal
					lands.
				</p>
				<h4>A Light in the Darkness</h4>
				<p>
					From time to time, as you hope to have sensed a change in
					the path through the dark, you take the flint, steel, and
					tinder from your pack. Then, you light a candle that has
					become distinctly shorter over the past few days. You take
					stock of the dank walls in the flickering light, and mark
					your passing with your knife. The futility of this action is
					not lost on you, but to give up this futile gesture would be
					to embrace failure and ultimately death.
				</p>
				<p>
					This time however, the change in your surroundings is more
					than an imagined suggestion. The scrunch of cave detriutus
					under your sandals turns into a whispering scuff. Your
					footstep seem to echo somewhat. The constant slow push of
					air through the limestone passages becomes still except for
					the sound of it flowing into a larger habitation.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you touch tinder to wick, in the guttering light of your
					dwindling candle, you see something more than the
					claustrophobic passages of the past week. An immense cavern
					opens before you with lines of massive carved columns
					stretching from the smmooth floors to the arched ceiling. A
					stone altar protrudes from the floor, facing down the aisle
					between the twin colonnades.
				</p>
				<h4>A Path to Salvation</h4>
				<P
					>You aproach the alter and carefully place your candle on
					the flat surface and peer closer an the strange grooves on
					its surface. The hot wax of candle drips down the stubby
					cylindrical body and flows into a groove on the altar's
					surface. The groove glows at the contact of the liquid
					parrafin, seeping amber and orange light as though the altar
					contains a small sun that is straining to escape its stone
					prison and flood the great hall with burning light.</P
				>
				<p>
					The immense hall is bathed in the orange and yellow glow of
					light emanating from the altar, and know the columns,
					revealing a door at the end of the aisle. Your eyes,
					squinting at the sudden assault, suddenly grow wide at the
					words inscribed in the thin air of the cavern in front of
					you and the glowing gems, set into the surface of the alter
					and faceted into the shapes of mystical beasts.
				</p> -->
				<h4>The Rules of the Game</h4>
				<p>The admonition is clear:</p>
				<p>
					Heed these words if you wish to escape the caverns of Bar
					Sholtan, realm of the dead. The unicorn crystals in front of
					you are the key to your escape - you will only know their
					numerical value by touching them. You must touch the
					appropriate crystals to bring their sum to the magical
					number emblazoned in the air in front of you. Equal the
					number and the doors to Marawara, land of the living, shall
					open wide before you. Surpass the number and you are doomed
					forever to wander the halls of the dead. Choose wisely
					traveler...
